# MUSWAH: MAPPING UKRAINIAN SACRAL WOODEN ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE 

## Mission

The MUSWAH initiative seeks to safeguard the digital data related to Ukrainian sacral wooden architectural heritage through the implementation of immediate and intermediate objectives in several phases. Its immediate aim is to identify, collect, and store a wide range of data to pave way for the preservation and restoration (both digital and physical) of Ukrainian sacral wooden architectural heritage in the long run. The project is spread across Phases 1-3.

### Phase 1 objectives

Identify, collect, and store digital data from across disparate sources for further digital and physical preservation and reconstruction of sacral wooden architecture lost, damaged, and otherwise endangered during the war in the territory of Ukraine:

1. Build and coordinate the work of a network of partners and volunteers in implementing the immediate and intermediate objectives
2. Identify the stakeholders who will benefit from this work and to whom the datasets and research resources of this project will be handed over (Stakeholder Analysis Document)
3. Outline a logistics workflow for data identification, collection, and storage, subject to regular revisions on a bi-monthly basis
4. Create an itemized record of sacral wooden architecture found in the territory of Ukraine (lost, damaged, or endangered by the war)
5. Identify repositories, websites, archives, and other sources of data available on the Ukrainian servers and outside 
6. Store the collected data in access-controlled storage before its handover to Ukrainian stakeholders involved in post-war archiving and dissemination of the data as well as in further restoration (digital and physical) of the wooden architectural heritage

### Phase 2 objectives
Disseminate, educate, and involve:

1.	Create college funded scholarships for visiting researchers with expertise in Ukrainian wooden heritage history and digital heritage reconstruction
2.	Make provisions for RTI kits and other equipment for ground data collection on demand
3.	Create a repository of videos (workshops, case studies) focused on training in disaster risk management for cultural heritage 
4.	Training of the team in the areas for which we do not have expertise 

### Phase 3 objectives 
Handover and review of further collaborative projects: 

1.	Oversee and carry out the handover of the safeguarded data to the established Ukrainian stakeholders
2.	Identify the opportunities for further collaborative projects with Ukrainian institutional partners in 3D restoration and preservation of wooden heritage
3.	Seek external funds for such projects
